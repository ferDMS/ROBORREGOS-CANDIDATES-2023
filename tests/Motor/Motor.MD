# Yellow Gearbox Motor and *Mini L298N* Driver

## Research

A motor is a device that turns electricity into movement. A common simple motor is a DC brushed motor, often employed in basic robotics projects. These motors function similarly to most others, by directing electrical current through coils that produce a magnetic field in opposition to permanent magnets. The resulting force between the magnetic fields induces the rotor to rotate, generating motion. This rotation can be of up to 17000 rpm.

A yellow gearbox motor consists of, precisely, a brushed DC motor and a gear box. The gear box is vital to increase the torque of the motor, which is the amount of weight it can induce rotation to. As a consequence of increasing this value, the final rpm will only be a fraction of the original brushed motor.

A motor driver is used to control the most basic elements of a simple motor, such as the yellow DC gear box motors frequently used on simple robots construction. These elements are:

* [Speed](#speed)
* [Direction](#direction)

### Speed

The speed of a motor is determined by the INPUT pins on the motor driver

### Direction
